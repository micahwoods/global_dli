* About this app

The global DLI app summarizes the past year of daily light integral (DLI) data for a user-selected location and then allows the user to download a chart of those data. The app is online at:

[[https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/global_dli/]]

The app uses the [[https://docs.ropensci.org/nasapower/index.html][nasapower]] R package to get global solar radiation data from the [[https://power.larc.nasa.gov/][NASA POWER]] agroclimatology dataset.

More information is available in the [[dli_details.md][dli_details.md]] file.

** Update 2024-01-23

The map with a box overlay showing the area checked has been removed, for now at least.

The phantomJS headless browser had been used, but seems inactive or unavailable now so it was not working. I tried to move to the webshot2 and mapshot2 packages/functions, but I couldn't get it to work. So for now I leave it at that.
